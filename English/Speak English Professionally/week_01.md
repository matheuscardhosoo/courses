# Create an Elevator Speech Outline

Hello, I’m so happy to meet you. My name is Matheus.
I’m a Computer Engineer in a brazilian company. I work developing a particle physics simulator. It may appear a bit specific and complex but particle simulations are very interesting and fundamental to understand and preview how our environment behaves. For this reason, many different industries use particle simulators to measure how efficient a process is and understand how to improve it. I would talk the entire day about this topic, but it is a long talk. I would love to tell you more about it in a second moment.

Thanks very much!
