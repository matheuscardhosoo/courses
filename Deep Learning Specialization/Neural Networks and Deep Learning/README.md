# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural Networks and Deep Learning at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning):

> In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, you will study the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 
> 
> By the end, you will be familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.
